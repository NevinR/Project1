Purpose of your application: (2 marks)
Idea for a Project: "Random Quote Generator “Create a web application that creates inspiring or random quotes each time a user hits a button. The program can be pre-populated with a selection of sayings or messages, and JavaScript can be used to display a different one every time the button is pressed. You can, at your discretion, provide a function that enables people to contribute their own quotations or messages to the database. I'll also be adding categories and qoute with 2 relatable tables. This project is simple to build and can give users access to a stimulating and enjoyable tool. It's a great approach to practice fundamental ASP.NET.
